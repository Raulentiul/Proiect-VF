- name: On Applying Residual Reasoning within Neural Network Verification
  website: null
  description: '<p>As neural networks are increasingly being integrated into&nbsp;mission-critical
    systems, it is becoming crucial to ensure that they meet<br>

    various safety and liveness requirements. Towards, that end, numerous&nbsp;complete
    and sound verification techniques have been proposed in recent&nbsp;years, but
    these often suffer from severe scalability issues. One recently&nbsp;proposed
    approach for improving the scalability of verification techniques&nbsp;is to enhance
    them with abstraction-refinement capabilities: instead of&nbsp;verifying a complex
    and large network, abstraction allows the verifier to&nbsp;construct and then
    verify a much smaller network; and the correctness of&nbsp;the smaller network
    immediately implies the correctness of the original,&nbsp;larger network. One
    shortcoming of this scheme is that whenever the<br>

    smaller network cannot be verified, the verifier must perform a refinement step,
    in which the size of the network being verified is increased.&nbsp;The verifier
    then starts verifying the new network from scratch &mdash; effectively &ldquo;forgetting&rdquo;
    its earlier work, in which the&nbsp; smaller network was&nbsp;verified. Here,
    we present an enhancement to abstraction-based neural&nbsp;network verification,
    which uses residual reasoning: a process where information acquired when verifying
    an abstract network is utilized in order&nbsp;to facilitate the verification of
    refined networks. At its core, the method&nbsp;enables the verifier to retain
    information about parts of the search space<br>

    in which it was determined that the refined network behaves correctly,&nbsp;allowing
    the verifier to focus on areas of the search space where bugs&nbsp;might yet be
    discovered. For evaluation, we implemented our approach&nbsp;as an extension to
    the Marabou verifier, and obtained highly promising&nbsp;results.</p>'

- name: 'Artifact for DNNV: A Framework for Deep Neural Network Verification'
  website: null
  description: '<p>Despite the large number of sophisticated deep neural network (DNN)
    verification algorithms, DNN verifier developers, users, and researchers still
    face several challenges. First, verifier developers must contend with the rapidly
    changing DNN field to support new DNN operations and property types. Second, verifier
    users have the burden of selecting a verifier input format to specify their problem.
    Due to the many input formats, this decision can greatly restrict the verifiers
    that a user may run. Finally, researchers face difficulties in re-using benchmarks
    to evaluate and compare verifiers, due to the large number of input formats required
    to run different verifiers. Existing benchmarks are rarely in formats supported
    by verifiers other than the one for which the benchmark was introduced. In this
    work we present DNNV, a framework for reducing the burden on DNN verifier researchers,
    developers, and users. DNNV standardizes input and output formats, includes a
    simple yet expressive DSL for specifying DNN properties, and provides powerful
    simplification and reduction operations to facilitate the application, development,
    and comparison of DNN verifiers. We show how DNNV increases the support of verifiers
    for existing benchmarks from 30% to 74%.<br>

    We provide an artifact containing the DNNV tool for DNN verification, as well
    as some benchmark problems on which to run DNNV. The artifact is provided as a

  website: null
  description: <p>Neural networks are powerful tools. Applying them in computer systems&mdash;operating
    systems, databases, and networked systems&mdash;attracts much attention. However,
    neural networks are complicated black boxes that may produce unexpected results.
    To train networks with well-defined behaviors, we introduce ouroboros, a system
    that constructs verified neural networks for computer systems. Verified neural
    networks are neural networks that satisfy user-defined safety properties, called
    specifications. Ouroboros builds verified networks by a training-verification
    loop that combines deep learning training and neural network verification. Ouroboros
    introduces multiple techniques to fill the gap between today&rsquo;s verification
    and the properties that systems require. Ouroboros also accelerates the training-verification
    loop by spec-aware learning. Our experiments show that ouroboros can train verified
    networks for all five applications that we study and has a 4.3&times; speedup
    on average compared with the vanilla training-verification loop.</p>

- name: General Boolean Formula Minimization with QBF Solvers
  website: null
  description: <p>The minimization of propositional formulae is a classical problem
    in logic, whose first algorithms date back at least to the 1950s with the works
    of Quine and Karnaugh. Most previous work in the area has focused on obtaining
    minimal, or quasi-minimal, formulae in conjunctive normal form (CNF) or disjunctive
    normal form (DNF), with applications in hardware design. In this paper, we are
    interested in the problem of obtaining an equivalent formula in any format, also
    allowing connectives that are not present in the original formula. We are primarily
    motivated in applying minimization algorithms to generate natural language translations
    of the original formula, where using shorter equivalents as input may result in
    better translations. Recently, Buchfuhrer and Umans have proved that the (decisional
    version of the) problem is <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&Sigma;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>complete.
    We analyze three possible (practical) approaches to solving the problem. First,
    using brute force, generating all possible formulae in increasing size and checking
    if they are equivalent to the original formula by testing all possible variable
    assignments. Second, generating the Tseitin coding of all the formulae and checking
    equivalence with the original using a SAT solver. Third, encoding the problem
    as a Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF), and using a QBF solver. Our results show
    that the QBF approach largely outperforms the other two.</p>

- name: ReBAC Availability Verifiers
  website: null
  description: '<p>This is the implementation of Availability Criteria (Satisfiability,
    Feasibility and Resiliency) Verifiers for Relationship-based Access Control with
    support for Multiple Ownership (ReBAC/MO). The following are informal examples
    of availability criteria.</p>


    <p>. Satisfiability: &quot;Object o shall be accessible by at least 35 users in
    the current protection state.&quot;</p>


    <p>. Resiliency: &quot;Even if I were to recruit 10 additional patients (or lose
    10 of my existing patients), object o shall remain accessible by at least 25 users.&quot;</p>


    <p>. Feasibility: &quot;I shall be able to make object o accessible by at least
    50 users if the company hires no more than 10 additional colleagues (or fires
    no more than 10 existing colleagues).&quot;</p>


    <p>The ReBAC/MO consists of the Boolean combinations of atomic policies. The atomic
    policies are represented by a 2-tuple; comprising a Birooted graph pattern (one
    root represents the owner, the other one represents the requester) and a vertex
    in the social graph, to which the owner in the graph pattern will be anchored.
    The availability criteria then boils down to finding the graph pattern(s) in the
    social graph that are isomorphic to the graph patterns in the atomic policies.
    The verifiers use different technologies as to decide availability criteria. Below
    we briefly explain each verifier.</p>


    <p>. In the first verifier we reduce the Availability Criteria (esp. Satisfiability)
    to Quantified Boolean Formula Satisfiability (QBF) and compile it into a non-prenex
    non-CNF format (QCIR). Please note, each atomic policy can be seen as an stand-alone
    Subgraph Isomorphism problem, hence, we use a fairly standard approach to reduce
    it to a Boolean Satifiability problem. The Boolean combination of Boolean Satisfiability
    problem (esp. with negations) yields a non-CNF QBF. A non-clausal QBF solver like
    RAReQS-NN or GhostQ can then be invoked to decide the availability criteria.&nbsp;</p>


    <p>. In the second verifier we employ an approach similar to the previous one.
    In nutshell, we reduce atomic policies to SAT problems and call a SAT solver (i.e.
    Sat4J) to solve it. Then we construct the original policy from the atomic policies
    and check if it is satisifiable.</p>


    <p>. In the third verifier we adopt a completely differnet approach. We reduce
    the availability criteria into an Answer Set Programming problem. Then an ASP
    solver (i.e. clingo) is invoked to decide the availability criteria.</p>

    procedures by means of a lemma speculation mechanism. This problem is important
    in order to widen the scope of decision procedures incorporated in state-of-the-art

- name: Reducing Acceptance Marks in Emerson-Lei Automata by QBF Solving
  website: null
  description: <p>This paper presents a novel application of QBF solving to automata
    reduction. We focus on Transition-based Emerson-Lei automata (TELA), which is
    a popular formalism that generalizes many traditional kinds of automata over infinite
    words including B&uuml;chi, co-B&uuml;chi, Rabin, Streett, and parity automata.
    Transitions in a TELA are labelled with acceptance marks and its accepting formula
    is a positive Boolean combination of atoms saying that a particular mark has to
    be visited infinitely or finitely often. Algorithms processing these automata
    are often very sensitive to the number of acceptance marks. We introduce a new
    technique for reducing the number of acceptance marks in TELA based on satisfiability
    of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). We evaluated our reduction technique on
    TELA produced by state-of-the-art tools of the libraries Owl and Spot and by the
    tool ltl3tela. The technique reduced some acceptance marks in automata produced
    by all the tools. On automata with more than one acceptance mark obtained by translation
    of LTL formulas from literature with tools Delag and Rabinizer 4, our technique
    reduced 27.7% and 39.3% of acceptance marks, respectively. The reduction was even
    higher on automata from random formulas.</p>

- name: Automated Temporal Verification for Algebraic Effects
  website: null
  description: <p>Although effect handlers offer a versatile abstraction for user-defined
    effects, they produce complex and less restricted execution traces due to the
    composable non-local control flow mechanisms. This paper is interested in the
    temporal behaviors of effect sequences, such as unhandled effects, termination
    of the communication, safety, fairness, etc. Specifically, we propose a novel
    effects logic ContEffs, to write precise and modular specifications for programs
    in the presence of user-defined effect handlers and primitive effects. As a second
    contribution, we devise a forward verifier together with a fixpoint calculator
    to infer the behaviors of such programs. Lastly, our automated verification framework
    provides a purely algebraic term-rewriting system (TRS) as the back-end solver,
    efficiently checking the entailments between ContEffs assertions. To demonstrate
    the feasibility of our proposals, we prototype a verification system where zero-shot,
    one-shot, and multi-shot continuations coexist; prove its correctness; present
    experimental results; and report on case studies.</p>

- name: Legal Grounds for Establishment and Termination of Business Associations
  website: null
  description: '<p>It is known that establishment of associations of business entities
    is included to the mechanisms for ensuring of favorable conditions for development
    of modern market relations. Their role increases every year but there are no clear
    provisions in legislation about the notion of associations of legal entities as
    well as there is no single direction for development of legal regulation of relations
    regarding their activities.</p>


    <p>According to the Commercial Code of Ukraine legal entities have the right to
    unite their own activities based on the agreement (particularly joint operation
    agreement) and by establishing new entities (particularly joint companies).</p>


    <p>Joint companies play an important role among members of commercial relations.</p>


    <p>Procedures of consolidating funds and concentrating production which take place
    in modern Ukrainian economy contribute to business associations. In spite of their
    active participation in commercial relations and taking into account historical
    and economic conditions of their activities legal regulation of organization and
    activities of business associations in various business spheres are inadequate
    because:</p>


    <p>i) there are incompliances in legislation regarding business associations;&nbsp;</p>


    <p>ii) on practice one can see that associations are established and exist in
    the forms which are not provided for by Ukrainian legislation such as business
    group, the group of companies, financial and industrial group etc. They are not&nbsp;legally
    formalized, registered, do not have clear rights and duties of members, legal
    status of property etc.</p>


    <p>Certain issues which shall be regulated in legislation relate to establishment
    and activities of business associations such as procedure of managing the state
    association; differentiation of authorities between the Cabinet of Ministers of
    Ukraine and central executive agencies regarding establishment of the state associations,
    approval of the articles of association, appointment of managers etc.</p>'

    \n<p>Download the whole repository to some directory <code>dir</code>, then:</p>\n\

    \ emergence/formation/formation.c</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each folder under <code>invariant</code>\
    \ and <code>emergence</code> contains a <code>&lt;program&gt;.c</code> file which\
    \ is the output of one the above commands. Notice that, for <code>approx-b</code>\
    \ and <code>maj</code>, we have manually performed some additional transformations.\
    \ The unmodified <code>sliver</code> output is named <code>maj.c.orig</code> and\
    \ the final program is named <code>maj.c</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Instrumentation of\
    \ C programs</p>\n\n<p>SLiVER was originally tailored towards BMC verification,\
    \ so it generates programs that can be directly verified by CBMC. Other tools\
    \ require an instrumentation steps. Typically this amounts to replace verification\
    \ intrinsics with those supported by the tools, add specific headers or function\
    \ declarations, etc. We have automated this steps by means of a helper Python\
    \ program called <code>absentee</code>, which can be found in the <code>tools</code>\
    \ directory and at (https://github.com/lou1306/absentee)</p>\n\n<p>Typically,\
    \ to instrument the SLiVER program <code>program.c</code> for verification by\
    \ a specific tool, one can use the following command line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cd\
    \ tools/absentee\ngcc -E /path/to/&lt;program&gt;.c | python3 -m absentee --conf\
    \ &lt;tool&gt;.conf - &gt; /path/to/&lt;program&gt;.&lt;tool&gt;.c</code></pre>\n\
    \n<p>Preprocessing the original program with <code>gcc</code> (or another compiler)\
    \ is needed because <code>absentee</code> does not support preprocessor directives.</p>\n\
    \n<p>Each folder under <code>invariant</code> and <code>emergence</code> already\
    \ contains a file <code>&lt;program&gt;.&lt;tool&gt;.c</code>, which is the result\
    \ of this step for each tool in our experimental evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>Verification</p>\n\
    \n<p>Each tool needs a specific set of arguments, environment variables, etc.\
    \ to correctly perform its verification task. To investigate the actual commands\
    \ we used in our evaluation, please check the <code>replication.sh</code> script\
    \ or the <code>replication.py</code> program.</p>\n\n<p>About the <code>stock</code>\
    \ case studies</p>\n\n<p>We wrote the <code>stock-safe</code> and <code>stock-unsafe</code>\
    \ case studies directly as triple structure, and then encoded it as C programs\
    \ using the same procedure described in the paper and implemented by <code>sliver</code>.</p>\n\
    \n<p>We provide these C programs, as well as their instumented version for 2ls,\
    \ in the <code>stock</code> folder.</p>\n\n<p>Usage instructions for <code>replication.py</code></p>\n\
    \n<p>In case one wants more granularity, <code>replication.py</code> may be run\
    \ manually. <code>./replication.py --help</code> shows usage instructions. In\
    \ brief:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><code>./replication.py</code> runs all the\
    \ experiments.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><code>./replication.py tool1 tool2 ...</code>\

    \ --list</code> lists the tool names.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><code>./replication\
    \ --timeout &lt;n&gt;</code> overrides the default timeout to <em>n</em> seconds\
    \ (<em>n</em> must be a positive integer)</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By adding\
    \ <code>--dry-run</code>, the script only shows the experiments&rsquo; command\
    \ lines, without actually executing them. Keep in mind that most tools also require\

    with arrays. This paper introduces a new abstract domain in 2LS for reasoning
    about the contents of arrays. In addition, we introduce an improved approach to
    loop unwinding, a crucial component of the 2LS&rsquo; verification algorithm,
    which particularly enables finding proofs and counterexamples for programs working
    with dynamic memory.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This artifact was submitted by Peter Pfeiffer, Mark Peyrer, Daniel Gro&szlig;e
    and Martina Seidl for the TACAS 2026 with the submission number 9062 aiming for
    Available, Functional and Reusable badges. It contains everything necessary to
    reproduce the examples shown in the corresponding paper alongside testcases to
    demonstrate basic functionality. In the following sections you will learn everything
    you need to know about this artifact and how to reproduce the experiments.</p>

    <p>The input formulas used by tests are divided into four categories:</p>

    <ul>

    <li><code>atleast</code> contains at-least-k cardinality constraints with randomly
    generated quantifier prefixes and different encodings (km-totalizer and sequential
    counters).</li>

    <h2>Running the artifact</h2>

    <h3>1. Setup Docker</h3>

    <p>A working docker environment installed on your machine is required. The docker
    container can be setup the following way:<br><br><code># download qsole-artifact.zst
    from zenodo</code><br><code>docker load &lt; qsole-artifact.zst</code><br><code>docker
    run -v `pwd`/output:/output -itd --network none --name qsole_running1 qsole-artifact</code><br><code>docker
    exec -it qsole_running1 bash</code></p>

    <p>The first line loads the docker-image from the the export, the second will
    create a container using the image and the last connects your current terminal
    to the container.</p>

    <p>In order to leave the container, just execute <code>exit</code>.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, you can call&nbsp;<br><br><code>docker stop qsole_running1</code><br><code>docker
    rm qsole_running1</code></p>

    <p>to stop and delete the running container.</p>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Please ensure to have a working docker setup, with
    your user added to the <code>docker</code> group. This can be verified using <code>docker
    ps</code>. If there are no errors, your environment should be in working order.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>2. Run the Smoke Test</h3>

    <p>We prepared a small script for you to check, if the tool was installed successfully.&nbsp;<br>This
    is just for your convenience, please feel free to use any of the provided ressources
    to conduct the smoke test.</p>

    <p>The script <code>/scripts/smoke_test.sh</code> will execute the following code</p>

    <p><br><code>/qsole/build/qsole --help</code><br><code>/qsole/build/qsole /test/paper_example/phi.qdimacs
    /test/paper_example/psi.qdimacs 3 --check sole --subsumption --info --noskip</code><br><br>i.e.
    printing the help-text and then solve the minimal example presented in the paper
    using a full Solution Equivalence Check.<br>The following output is to be expected,
    if the artifact is up and running.</p>

    <p><code>qsole v0.1 - a checker qbf solution equivalence</code><br><code>usage:
    qsole FORMULA1 FORMULA2 PCOUNT [OPTIONS...]</code></p>

    <p><code>FORMULA1 expects a file containing a QDIMACS encoded QBF</code><br><code>FORMULA2
    expects a file containing a QDIMACS encoded QBF</code><br><code>PCOUNT expects
    the length of the common prefix</code><br><code>The following values for OPTIONS

    Loops'
  website: null
  description: '<p>This paper introduces the Octave-State Formalism, a novel theoretical
    framework for the analysis of computational loops. Moving beyond the classical,
    one-dimensional view of iteration, this formalism models a loop''s execution as
    the discrete-time evolution of a state vector within an eight-dimensional abstract
    space. Each dimension of this "Octave-State" corresponds to a fundamental aspect
    of the loop''s behavior, including its temporal progression, data transformation,
    causal dependencies, resource consumption, concurrency potential, numerical stability,
    control flow path, and termination horizon. By leveraging the mathematical rigor
    of state-space representation from control theory and drawing conceptual parallels
    with principles from theoretical physics&mdash;such as dimensional regularization,
    phase space, and the many-worlds interpretation&mdash;this paper develops a unified
    model. We demonstrate that this formalism provides a more holistic understanding
    of loop dynamics, offering new geometric insights into complex problems like data
    dependency analysis, loop-level parallelism, and formal verification through loop
    invariants. The Octave-State Formalism is presented not merely as a descriptive
    tool, but as a generative framework for the design and automated analysis of next-generation
    algorithms and high-assurance software systems.</p>

  description: '<p>Information flow policies are widely used for specifying confidentiality
    and integrity requirements of security-critical systems. In contrast to access
    control policies and security protocols, they impose global constraints on the
    information flow and thus provide end-to-end security guarantees. The information
    flow policy that is usually adopted is non-interference. It postulates that con
    dential data must not affect the publicly visible behavior of a system. However, this
    requirement is usually broken in the presence of cryptographic operations. </p>


    <p>In this paper, we provide an extended definition of non-interference for systems
    that are specified in a MILS variant of the Architecture Analysis and Design Language
    (AADL). More concretely, we propose a type system for MILS-AADL component definitions
    that distinguishes between breaking non-interference because of legitimate use
    of sufficientlynbsp;strong encryption and breaking non-interference due to annbsp;unintended
    information leak. To this aim, it tracks bothnbsp;intra- and inter-component information

    <li><strong>Title</strong>: (Semantic) Feature Model Differences with (Q)SAT</li>\n\
    <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Feature models evolve in multiple iterations over\
    \ time. When modellers change a model, they enact syntactical changes in order\
    \ to produce specific semantic differences between model iterations. Many tools\
    \ have been developed to analyze such syntactical differences, but the changing\
    \ semantics of models were harder to assess. Tools for semantic differences between\
    \ feature model iterations rely on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) or encode each\
    \ change into SAT, the former leading to BDD scaling issues and the latter requiring\
    \ editor support or other specialized tooling. We contribute the first concise\
    \ formalization of feature models and their semantic differences into propositional\
    \ logic and use it to efficiently and scalably classify semantic differences using\
    \ SAT solvers. We then extend our definition into QSAT in order to quantify the\
    \ full list of semantic differences between feature models and enumerate them\
    \ using QBF tools, without needing specialized feature model solvers. We implement\
    \ a semantic difference classifier using our UVL processing pipeline based on\
    \ Booleguru (instead of the more widely used FeatureIDE) and evaluate it on industrial\
    \ feature model instances in the standardized UVL format. We also evaluate our\
    \ QSAT-based semantic difference enumerator and reproduce prior results. We provide\
    \ all software and evaluation results in an artifact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"\

- name: 'TokenJoin: Efficient Filtering for Set Similarity Join with Maximum Weighted
    Bipartite Matching'
  website: null
  description: <p>Set similarity join is an important problem with many applications
    in data discovery, cleaning and integration. To increase robustness, fuzzy set
    similarity join calculates the similarity of two sets based on maximum weighted
    bipartite matching instead of set overlap. This allows pairs of elements, represented
    as sets or strings, to also match approximately rather than exactly, e.g., based
    on Jaccard similarity or edit distance. However, this significantly increases
    the verification cost, making even more important the need for efficient and effective
    filtering techniques to reduce the number of candidate pairs. The current state-of-the-art
    algorithm relies on similarity computations between pairs of elements to filter
    candidates. In this paper, we propose token-based instead of element-based filtering,
    showing that it is significantly more lightweight, while offering similar or even
    better pruning effectiveness. Moreover, we address the top-𝑘 variant of the problem,
    alleviating the need for a user-specified similarity threshold. We also propose
    early termination to reduce the cost of verification. Our experimental results
    on six real-world datasets show that our approach always outperforms the state
    of the art, being an order of magnitude faster on average.</p>

  description: System requirements frequently change while the system is still under
    development. Usually this means going back and revising the requirements specification
    and redoing those development steps already completed. In this article we show
    how formal requirements can be allowed to evolve while system development is in
    progress, without the need for costly redevelopment. This is done via a formalism
    which allows requirements engineering steps to be interleaved with formal development
    steps in a manageable way. The approach is demonstrated by a significant case
    study, the Light Control System.

    is interesting for QSAT research because it is both conceptually simple and parametrized
    in a way that allows for a fine-grained diversity in the level of difficulty of
    its instances. Additionally, when coupled with symmetry breaking, the formulas
    in this family exhibit backbones (unique satisfying assignments) at the top-level
    existential variables. This benchmark is thus suitable for addressing questions
    regarding the connection between the existence of backbones and the hardness of

    wearable gadgets and physiological sensors. Those devices are connected to every
    different thru radio frequency conversation via air medium, and form a network
    of interconnected devices around the human body, normally known as the wireless

    challenges: 1) electricity consumption, and 2) security, for such electricity-restricted

    reasons for the electricity performance of HBC is due to the low loss channel

    A Prospective Comparative Clinical Study'
  website: null
  description: '<p><strong>Introduction:&nbsp;</strong>Second trimester termination
    of pregnancy accounts for around 10 to 15% of all abortions annually. These can
    be performed either medically or surgically. The aim of this study is to compare
    the efficacy and safety of extraamniotic mannitol along with carboprost (PGF2&alpha;)
    and intracervical misoprostol in second trimester termination of pregnancy.&nbsp;<strong>Result:&nbsp;</strong>The
    most common indication for termination of pregnancy was intrauterine fetal demise
    (41.7% in mannitol group and 45.8% in misoprostol group). Second trimester termination
    of pregnancy success rate was significantly higher in the extra-amniotic mannitol
    along with PGF2&alpha; group as compared to intracervical misoprostol group (95.8%
    v/s 75%, p&lt;0.05).A significantly shorter duration from induction to delivery
    was observed in the extra-amniotic mannitol along with PGF2&alpha; group as compared
    to intracervical misoprostol group (19.3 &plusmn; 4.2 v/s 22.3 &plusmn; 2.1 hours,
    p&lt;0.01).Incidence of side effects like pyrexia, diarrhea, abdominal pain and
    headache were significantly lower in the mannitol group as compared to misoprostol
    group.&nbsp;<strong>Conclusion:</strong>&nbsp;Extra-amniotic mannitol along with
    carboprost (PGF2&alpha;) is an effective and safe method for second trimester
    termination of pregnancy. The success rate of extra amniotic mannitol along with
    PGF2&alpha; was significantly higher with notably shorter induction-abortion interval.
    A remarkable lower hospital stay and fewer side effects were seen in patients
    induced by mannitol along with PGF2&alpha;.</p>

- name: A comparative study of second trimester termination of pregnancy with mifepristone
    and misoprostol vs misoprostol alone in 50 cases
  website: null
  description: 'The aim: To study the efficacy and safety of combined mifepristone
    and misoprostol used in second-trimester abortion(≥ 12 and ≤ 20 weeks) in comparison
    with only vaginal misoprostol.



    Materials and methods: This study was a prospective comparative randomised clinical
    study in women attending hospitals in need of a second-trimester abortion, i.e.,
    12–20 weeks of pregnancy were taken up and divided as Group A – 50 women with
    mifeprisptone and misoprostol, Group B – 50 women with misoprostol alone Results
    were analysed according to age, parity, gestational age, average dose of misoprostol
    required for complete abortion, Induction abortion interval, completeness of abortion,
    side effects and mean days of hospital stay.



    Results: Demographic details are comparable and insignificant in the comparison.
    The average dose of misoprostol (mcg) required for the completeness of abortion
    in group A is 596±28.28 mcg, and in group B, it is 1148±160.66 mcg (p&lt;0.001)
    which is statistically significant. In the present study, the induction abortion
    interval is significantly less in group A compared to group B, with p&lt;0.001.
    In addition, 10 out of 50 patients in group A aborted within 7 hours, whereas
    none in group B. Mean duration of hospital stay in group A is 24 hours. In group
    B, it is 34.82 hours which is statistically significant with a p-value of &lt;0.001.
    12 patients in group A and 26 in group B had side effects like nausea, vomiting,
    fever, headache and diarrhoea. 8 % of group A and 20 % of group B had a fever.
    These patients were treated with antipyretics. 6 % in group A and 14 % in group
    B had nausea and vomiting and were treated with antiemetics. 4 % in group A and
    8 % in group B had diarrhoea and were treated with antimotility drugs. 6 % in
    group A and 10 % in group B had a headache; these patients were treated with NSAIDs.



    Conclusions: The combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is a highly effective
    and safe method for second-trimester termination of pregnancy. The amount of misoprostol
    needed to accomplish the abortion, and the severity of the adverse effects are
    lower in the mifepristone-primed group than in the misoprostol-alone group. Since
    there are fewer difficulties, this approach can be employed in hospitals with
    high patient density.'

- name: Rho-dependent terminators and transcription termination
  website: null
  description: Rho-dependent transcription terminators participate in sophisticated
    genetic regulatory mechanisms, in both bacteria and phages; they occur in regulatory
    regions preceding the coding sequences of genes and within coding sequences, as
    well as at the end of transcriptional units, to prevent readthrough transcription.
    Most Rho-dependent terminators have been found in enteric bacteria, but they also
    occur in Gram-positive bacteria and may be widespread among bacteria. Rho-dependent
    termination requires bothcis-acting elements, on the mRNA, andtrans-acting factors.
    The onlycis-acting element common to Rho-dependent terminators is richness in
    rC residues. Additional sequence elements have been observed at different Rho
    termination sites. These 'auxiliary elements' may assist in the termination process;
    they differ among terminators, their occurrence possibly depending on the function
    and sequence context of the terminator. Specific nucleotides required for termination
    have also been identified at Rho sites. Rho is the main factor required for termination;
    it is a ring-shaped hexameric protein with ATPase and helicase activities. NusG,
    NusA and NusB are additional factors participating in the termination process.
    Rho-dependent termination occurs by binding of Rho to ribosome-free mRNA, C-rich
    sites being good candidates for binding. Rho's ATPase is activated by Rho–mRNA
    binding, and provides the energy for Rho translocation along the mRNA; translocation
    requires sliding of the message into the central hole of the hexamer. When a polymerase
    pause site is encountered, the actual termination occurs, and the transcript is
    released by Rho's helicase activity. Many aspects of this process are still being
    studied. The isolation of mutants suppressing termination, site-directed mutagenesis
    ofcis-acting elements in Rho-dependent termination, and biochemistry, are and
    will be contributing to unravelling the still undefined aspects of the Rho termination
    machinery. Analysis of the more sophisticated regulatory mechanisms relying on
    Rho-dependent termination may be crucial in identifying new essential elements
    for termination.

  website: null
  description: '<p><strong>The aim of the present study</strong>&nbsp;was to investigate
    the socio-demographic and obstetric profile of pregnant women, seeking medical
    termination of pregnancy in accordance with the Medical Termination of Pregnancy
    (MTP) Act and the reasons for undergoing termination of pregnancy in the tertiary
    care center of the hilly region of Northern India and to further review the amendments
    in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971 along with its future implications
    in legalizing abortions in India.</p>


    <p><strong>Materials and Methods</strong>: A registry-based retrospective study
    was carried out among pregnant women, attending the gynecologic outpatient department
    for termination of pregnancy at the tertiary care teaching hospital and the referral
    center for Himalayan foothills in Northern India. The records of women, seeking
    termination of pregnancy during a 1-year period between October 2020 and September
    2021, were reviewed and information on their demographic and obstetric profile,
    reason for undergoing termination of pregnancy, and acceptance of contraception,
    following termination of pregnancy was recorded in the data sheet. The information
    obtained was analyzed using SPSS version 20 (IBM, Chicago, USA) for descriptive
    statistics.</p>


    <p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;A total of 400 pregnant women underwent Medical
    Termination of Pregnancy between October 2020 and September 2021. 30.5 % (122/400)
    women between 26&ndash;30 years of age underwent termination of pregnancy, followed
    by 27.3 % women aged between 31&ndash;35 years. Social reasons for termination
    of pregnancy were more evident in women aged 26 years and above. 84.09 % pregnancies
    were terminated in the second trimester (&gt;12 weeks) on eugenic ground, while
    65.01 % pregnancies were terminated in the first trimester (6&ndash;12 weeks)
    on social grounds. Only 7.75 % (31/400) women opted for sterilization or family
    planning after MTP, out of which the majority opted for temporary methods of contraception.</p>


    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We conclude from the results of the present study
    that women in the peak reproductive age (26&ndash;30 years) are more likely to
    seek pregnancy termination and this group of women needs to be the focus of contraceptive
    counseling and family planning services. Timely ultrasound scans by an expert
    sonologist may be a step forward towards lowering the rates of late pregnancy
    termination. There is a need to educate women to avail and use contraceptive methods
    in an effective manner and to make them aware of utilizing sterilization services,
    once they complete their families to avoid unwanted pregnancies.</p>'

    The update of the corporate legislation has necessitated a review of the established
    positions on the moment of termination of corporate legal relations, analysis
    and study of the legislation and resolution of problems that arise in connection
    with its application. The introduction of the institution of consent in corporate
    legal relations necessitated a scientific rethinking of certain aspects of the
    mechanism of termination of corporate legal relations. The article investigates
    the main scientific approaches to determining the moment of termination of corporate
    legal relations, analyzes the moment of termination of corporate legal relations
    depending on the grounds for their termination. Based on four main approaches
    to determining the moment of termination of corporate legal relations, the positions
    of scientists who adhere to them are studied, changes to the current corporate
    legislation are analyzed, inconsistencies regarding the moment of termination
    of corporate legal relations are revealed. The peculiarities of the moment of
    termination of corporate legal relations in case of alienation of a share (part
    of a share) in the authorized capital of the company, exclusion of a participant
    from the company, its withdrawal, withdrawal, recovery from the defendant (claim

    of state registration of changes in information about a legal entity in the aspect
    of determining the moment of termination of corporate legal relations are determined.
    A position has been formed regarding the application of a separate approach to

    :<br>The <i>Medical Termination of Pregnancy<strong> </strong></i>Act, 1971 is

    </strong>(Amendment)<strong> </strong></i>Act, 2021 was a welcome step. Though
    the amendment made many necessary changes in the MTP Act. The aforementioned Amendment
    Act has failed to give any recognition to the right to abortion as a right to
    privacy of a pregnant woman. At no point of time during pregnancy can a pregnant
    woman seek abortion as per her choice. The Abortion law as such does not provide
    a pregnant woman right over her body making an essential human right like the
    right to privacy meaningless to a pregnant woman.<i> </i>The judiciary has time
    and again reiterated right to abortion as a right to privacy through different
    judgments. However, the legislature has time and again failed to give recognition
    to the same including the<i> Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act

    <p>In the current pandemic, there are many problems that arise. Not only from
    the health aspect, but also from the employment aspect, human rights, etc. Moreover,
    in terms of rights, there are issues regarding the rights and obligations of workers
    who directly experience termination of employment (PHK). This is considered not
    in accordance with the rights and obligations of the workers, but due to the current
    pandemic conditions and leading to a crisis in all aspects of the field, the decision
    to lay off is the final decision made by the companies in order to avoid further
    losses in the company. Reducing employees is considered efficiency because it
    can help reduce expenses. There are so many companies that suppress HR behind
    this pandemic. There are layoffs, because there is no financial capability on
    the part of the company. It is felt, a pandemic situation like this is a responsibility
    and also a problem from all aspects. Not only about employees, but also the government,
    companies, all feel the impact of this pandemic.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>


    <p>Terhadap kondisi pendemi seperti saat ini sangat banyak problematika yang muncul.
    Tidak hanya dari aspek kesehatan, namun juga aspek ketenagakerjaan, hak asasi
    manusia, dll. Terlebih lagi dalam hak, adapun permasalahan atas hak dan kewajiban
    para pekerja yang secara langsung mendapati Pemutusan Hubungan Kerja (PHK). Hal
    ini dinilai tidak sesuai dengan hak dan kewajiban para pekerja, namun dikarenakan
    kondisi pandemi yang sepeeti ini dan berujung pada krisis disegala aspek bidang,
    maka keputusan PHK nenjadi keputusan akhir yang dilakukan oleh para perusahaan
    meningat agar tidak semakin rugi dalam perusahaan tersebut. Mengurangi karyawan
    adalah dianggap efisiensi karena dapat membantu mengurangi pengeluaran. Banyak
    sekali perusahaan yang menekan SDM di balik keadaan pandemi seperti ini. PHK ada,
    karena sudah tidak adanya kemampuan dari pihak perusahaan dari sisi keuangan.
    Dirasa, keadaan pandemi seperti imi adalah tanggungjawab dan juga masalah dari
    segala aspek. Tidak hanya tentang pegawai, namun juga pemerintahan, perusahaan,
    semua ikut merasakan dampak dari keadaan pandemi ini.</p>

  description: '<p>The factors governing the initiation and development of <em>K.
    brevis</em> blooms in the eastern Gulf<br>

    of Mexico are fairly well understood, however the physical, chemical and biological
    factors<br>

    underlying bloom transport and termination are not. The Florida Fish and Wildlife
    Conservation<br>

    Commission&rsquo;s HAB Monitoring database was analyzed from 1998 - 2021 for temporal
    trends in<br>

    bloom duration, initiation and termination and for repetitive spatial patterns
    in bloom termination.<br>

    A unimodal pattern in bloom initiation was observed, with the most frequent initiations
    in<br>

    September. Bloom termination was more variable, with the most frequent occurrences
    in April.<br>

    Four recurring patterns in bloom termination were identified during this period
    for southwest<br>

    Florida <em>K. brevis</em> blooms: 1) coastal transport south to the Florida Keys
    then west into the<br>

    Gulf of Mexico, 2) transport to the Florida Panhandle with subsequent termination
    in place,<br>

    or 3) via coastal transport west to Alabama, and 4) termination in place in southwest
    Florida.<br>

    These patterns suggest that consistent physical, chemical and biological drivers
    underlie the<br>

    termination stages of <em>K. brevis </em>blooms, and that identification of these
    drivers may provide<br>

    useful management tools for bloom prediction and monitoring.</p>'

  description: '<p>This paper introduces Primary Breadth-First Development (PBFD)
    and Primary Depth-First Development (PDFD), two formally defined and verified
    methodologies for scalable, industrial-grade full-stack software engineering.
    These approaches bridge a longstanding gap between formal methods and real-world
    development practice by enforcing structural correctness through graph-theoretic
    modeling.&nbsp;Unlike prior graph-based approaches, PBFD and PDFD operate over
    layered directed graphs and are formalized using unified state machines and Communicating
    Sequential Processes (CSP) to ensure critical properties, including bounded-refinement
    termination and structural completeness.</p>

    <p>To coordinate hierarchical data at scale, we propose Three-Level Encapsulation
    (TLE)&mdash;a novel, bitmask-based encoding scheme that delivers provably constant-time
    updates. TLE&rsquo;s formal guarantees underpin PBFD&rsquo;s industrial-scale
    performance and scalability.</p>

    <p>PBFD was empirically validated through an eight-year enterprise deployment,
    demonstrating over 20&times; faster development than Salesforce OmniScript and
    7&ndash;8&times; faster query performance compared to conventional relational
    models. Additionally, both methodologies are supported by open-source MVPs, with
    PDFD&rsquo;s implementation conclusively demonstrating its correctness-first design
    principles.</p>

    <p>Together, PBFD and PDFD establish a reproducible, transparent framework that
    integrates formal verification into practical software development. All formal
    specifications, MVPs, and datasets are publicly available to foster academic research
    and industrial-grade&nbsp;adoption.</p>'

    during the Covid-19 Pandemic
  website: null
  description: <p>This research examined from a legal perspective regarding the unilateral
    termination of employment by PT Indosat Tbk, during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Two
    main issues were discussed in this study, the first was the chronology of unilateral
    termination carried out by PT Indosat Tbk to its employees during the Covid-19
    pandemic, and analyzing the legal termination procedural during the Covid-19 Pandemic.
    This study used a normative juridical research method using secondary legal data.
    Based on the results of the study, it was known that the chronology of layoffs
    was carried out by PT. Indosat, Tbk to its workers during the Covid-19 pandemic
    was unilateral. Meanwhile, the legal termination procedure during the Covid-19
    pandemic must go through the stages of negotiations between the employers, in
    this case, PT. Indosat, Tbk with employees represented by existing labor associations.
    In its implementation carried out, PT. Indosat, Tbk did not carry out negotiations
    before carrying out simultaneous termination. In connection with the above, the
    employer should negotiate first before implementing efficiency by doing the termination
    of employment (PHK).</p>

    by Justus Fasse and Bart Jacobs</p>


    <p>The file contains Coq theories built on top of Iris 4.0.</p>


    <p>To facilitate comparison with the original Iris/HeapLang development, from
    which this artifact is derived, the source code is provided as a git bundle.</p>


    <p>## How to build</p>


    <p>Unpacking the git bundle<br>

    - `git clone artifact.bundle`<br>

    - `cd artifact`<br>

    - You should now already be on the `HeapLangLt` branch</p>


    <p>To build<br>

    - `opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released`<br>

    - `opam pin add coq-iris 4.0.0`<br>

    - `dune build`</p>


    <p>## Directory structure</p>


    <p>The rough directory structure of the development is described next. A precise
    list of changes can be obtained via git&#39;s diff mechanism.</p>


    <p>1. The directory `modular_termination/` which defines the global ghost resource
    tracking the stock of call permissions, an instance of the Auth(Multiset) camera.<br>

    The Auth(Multiset) camera is reused in the proof of the concurrent stack with
    helping.</p>


    <p>&nbsp; - `auth_gmultiset.v` constructs the general Auth(Multiset) camera construction
    with some helper lemmas<br>

    &nbsp; - `call_permissions.v` defines the global ghost resource used to reason
    about HeapLang&lt;&#39;s stock of call permissions</p>


    <p>2. `iris_heap_lang/` provides an adapted version of Iris 4.0&#39;s HeapLang
    that defines HeapLang&lt;.</p>


    <p>&nbsp; - `lang.v` defines the extended syntax and semantics of HeapLang&lt;<br>

    &nbsp; - `iris_heap_lang/primitive_laws.v` contains the `wp_burn` lemma<br>

    &nbsp; - `iris_heap_lang/termination.v` gives the definitions and proofs that
    a HeapLang&lt; program with &quot;enough burns&quot; (defined in the same file)
    cannot have infinite executions</p>


    <p>3. `concurrent-stack-with-helping` contains the code for the case study of
    a concurrent stack with helping with a HoCAP-style specification. In general both
    the original code and our adaptions are present. In those cases, the definition
    with the prime (e.g. `concurrent_stack` vs. `concurrent_stack&#39;`) is the version
    adapted for termination verification.</p>


    <p>&nbsp; - `specs.v` defines the HoCAP-style specification for concurrent stacks<br>

    &nbsp; - `concurrent_stack4.v` gives an implementation satisfying the extended
    specification. The main theorems of the example are `push&#39;_works` (`push&#39;`
    corresponds to `push_inner` in the report), `push_outer_works` (`push_outer` corresponds
    to `push` in the report) and finally the proofs that the implementation satisfies
    the specification: `spec&#39;`.<br>

    &nbsp; - `client.v` defines a simple client of the specification. It creates a
    concurrent stack and pushes 42 twice to it, once in a forked off thread and once
    in the original thread.</p>'

- name: Reproduction Package for FSE 2025 Submission `A Modular Program-Transformation
    Framework for Reducing Specifications to Reachability'
  website: null
  description: '<p>This is the Artifact for the paper &ldquo;A Modular Program-Transformation
    Framework for Reducing Specifications to Reachability&rdquo; which has been submitted
    to FSE 2025.</p>

    <p>The FSE article presents a program transformation framework with the goal of
    verifying different properties with of-the-shelf reachability analyzers. The transformations
    in a framework is based on instrumentation automata, inspired by the BLAST query
    language. In our initial study, we support three important concrete specifications
    for C programs: termination, no-overflow, and memory cleanup. This artifact can
    be used to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper. We demonstrate the
    effectiveness and efficiency of our transformations by comparing verifiers that
    support the specifications natively with verifiers for reachability applied to
    the transformed programs. The results are very promising: Our transformations
    can extend existing verifiers to be effective on specifications that they do not
    support natively, and that the efficiency is often similar to verifiers that natively
    support the considered specifications.</p>

    <p>The artifact consists of Makefile that can be used to download all the revisions
    of the tools used in the evaluation. Moreover, it downloads the transformation
    framework from git repository and sets it to the right version and branch. Further,
    it contains benchmarking definitions used by BenchExec to execute the experiments
    and processing scripts of the results that were used to generate the tables. Folder
    <code>figures-generation/results-FSE2025</code> contains all the data that we
    computed.</p>

    <h3>Contents</h3>

    <p>The artifact contains the following items: - <code>README.{html,md}</code>:
    this documentation - <code>Makefile</code>: makefile containing all the commands
    for getting the source code of all the tools and our framework - <code>benchmark-defs/</code>:
    definitions needed for BenchExec to run the experiments - <code>figures-generation/</code>:
    folder containing all the processing scripts for the results and the results form
    our experiments - <code>tasks/</code>: definitions for our selected subsets of
    tasks that can be used to run the tool</p>

  description: '<p>Operating a launcher is not exempt from risks. Even if we are talking
    about a reliable and tested system, the launchers need to operate in a very harsh
    environment. Thus, any issue can cause a failure and the loss of the control on
    the system. During the ascent phase, any failure implies risks to human lives
    since it would be a huge uncontrolled vehicle full of flammable fuel. Therefore,
    the launchers are tracked and monitored during the ascent phase, and in case any
    issue is detected, the launcher needs to immediately terminate (typically exploding).</p>

    <p>A traditional flight termination architecture ensures independency from the
    vehicle functional chain using a radar network with human involvement in the decision-making
    process. This means: (i) considerable budget share for infrastructure and operations,
    (ii) limited flexibility (radar network needed), (iii) vehicle monitoring restricted
    to LOS conditions and (iv) delay inherent to communications and human reaction.</p>

    <p>The autonomous flight termination systems (AFTS) determine the safety of the
    flight by processing different tracking inputs and comparing current estimated
    state to flight rules (also known as mission rules), defined by the user during
    flight missionization phase. By processing the mission rules directly on-board,
    the reaction time is reduced, and the telemetry downlink is no longer required.</p>

    <p>Within Europe, there is no clear standard on the design nor operation of an
    AFTS. The critical part of this type of standards is related to managing the idiosyncrasy
    of the flight regulation in each country, making it difficult to have a common
    standard in Europe. The solution proposed is to have a highly configurable unit,
    in which the range safety officer could even include proprietary software for
    the termination logic, thus adapting to each specific local flight regulation
    without the need to perform any factory customization.</p>

    <p>The paper describes the general problem and the proposed solution for a European
    Autonomous Flight Termination System highly configurable by the user, which make
    is suitable for a broad range of launchers and countries. Sener is developing
    an AFTU demonstrator in the frame of the RD EC Horizon Europe programme.</p>'

    Vegetable Systems
  website: null
  description: '<p>A key aspect in cover crop management is termination before the
    cash crop is planted.<br>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of termination
    methods on ground-dwelling<br>arthropods. The conventional mechanical termination
    method&mdash;i.e., green manuring by means of a<br>disc harrow&mdash;was compared
    to flattening using a roller crimper. Two different crop systems were<br>investigated
    for two growing seasons; cauliflower was grown in autumn after the termination
    of a<br>mixture of cowpea, pearl millet, and radish, and tomato was cropped in
    spring and summer after the<br>termination of a mixture of barley and vetch. Ground
    beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), rove beetles<br>(Coleoptera: Staphylinidae),
    and spiders (Araneae) were sampled by means of standard pitfall<br>traps throughout
    the growing season of both cash crops. The roller crimper increased the overall<br>abundance
    of ground beetles in the first growing season of both cash crops, whereas in the
    second<br>year, no significant effect could be detected. Rove beetles were more
    abundant in plots where the<br>cover crops were terminated by the roller crimper.
    Finally, green manuring increased the abundance<br>of spiders, especially on the
    first sampling date after cover crop termination. Albeit different taxa<br>showed
    different responses, the termination of cover crops by a roller crimper generally
    increased the<br>abundance of ground dwelling arthropods. Given that most of the
    sampled species were generalist<br>predators, their increased abundance could
    possibly improve biological control</p>'

  website: null
  description: '<p>This paper presents the development and testing of an&nbsp;Autonomous
    Flight Termination Unit (AFTU) within the&nbsp;SAFEST project framework. Traditional
    flight termination&nbsp;systems rely heavily on ground-based infrastructure, which&nbsp;limits
    flexibility, incurs high costs, and introduces delays&nbsp;due to human decision-making.
    The proposed AFTU&nbsp;leverages advances in GNSS technology, onboard&nbsp;computational
    capabilities, and avionics software platforms&nbsp;to enable real-time, autonomous
    termination decisions. The&nbsp;unit is highly configurable, allowing range safety
    officers to&nbsp;define mission-specific rules and integrate proprietary&nbsp;software
    to meet varying national regulations across Europe.</p>

    <p>The paper focuses on the initial prototype''s test campaign that Sener is developing
    in the frame of the RD EC Horizon Europe programme., detailing the system architecture,
    test setup, and performance results. It also outlines the roadmap toward flight

    \ program property called\n            path-length\n            . We describe\
    \ the analyses which are needed before the path-length can be computed such as\
    \ sharing, cyclicity, and aliasing. Then we formally define the path-length analysis\
    \ and prove it correct with respect to a reference denotational semantics of the\
    \ bytecode. We show that a constraint logic program\n            P\n         \
    \   \n              CLP\n            \n            can be built from the result\
    \ of the path-length analysis of a Java bytecode program\n            P\n    \
    \        and formally prove that if\n            P\n            \n           \
    \   CLP\n            \n            terminates, then\n            P\n         \
    \   also terminates. Hence a termination prover for constraint logic programs\
    \ can be applied to prove the termination of\n            P\n            . We\
    \ conclude with some discussion of the possibilities and limitations of our approach.\
    \ Ours is the first existing termination analyzer for Java bytecode dealing with\
    \ any kind of data structures dynamically allocated on the heap and which does\
    \ not require any help or annotation on the part of the user."

  description: <p>Breaching of contractual obligations may lead to certain negative
    consequences. Hence, this work analyzes the theoretical aspects of termination
    of contractual obligations in Ukraine&rsquo;s civil law. The article aims to study
    the obligation termination mechanism by determining the legal framework for its
    functioning. The author focuses on one of the forms of contractual obligation
    termination, more specifically, the start of cancellation and deferred status
    of a legal transaction. Using normative and protective functions in legislation,
    the author plans to determine specifics of legal facts of normative compensatory
    nature. It is established, that the condition for cancellation of a legal transaction,
    can be a direct or reverse mechanism for the termination of contractual obligations.
    A condition for cancellation of a legal transaction can be applied to the whole
    transaction or to its separate parts.</p>

    the evolution of insect seasonality'
  website: null
  description: Evolutionary change in the timing of dormancy enables animals and plants
    to adapt to changing seasonal environments and can result in ecological speciation.
    Despite its clear biological importance, the mechanisms underlying the evolution
    of dormancy timing in animals remain poorly understood because of a lack of anatomical
    landmarks to discern which phase of dormancy an individual is experiencing. Taking
    advantage of the nearly universal characteristic of metabolic suppression during
    insect dormancy (diapause), we use patterns of respiratory metabolism to document
    physiological landmarks of dormancy and test which of the distinct phases of the
    dormancy developmental pathway contribute to a month-long shift in diapause timing
    between a pair of incipient moth species. Here, we show that divergence in life
    cycle between the earlier-emerging E-strain and the later-emerging Z-strain of
    European corn borer (ECB) is clearly explained by a delay in the timing of the
    developmental transition from the diapause maintenance phase to the termination
    phase. Along with recent findings indicating that life-cycle differences between
    ECB strains stem from allelic variation at a single sex-linked locus, our results
    demonstrate how dramatic shifts in animal seasonality can result from simple developmental
    and genetic changes. Although characterizing the multiple phases of the diapause
    developmental programme in other locally adapted populations and species will
    undoubtedly yield surprises about the nature of animal dormancy, results in the
    ECB moth suggest that focusing on genetic variation in the timing of the dormancy
    termination phase may help explain how (or whether) organisms rapidly respond
    to global climate change, expand their ranges after accidental or managed introductions,
    undergo seasonal adaptation, or evolve into distinct species through allochronic
    isolation.

- name: Ensuring Termination in ESFP
  website: null
  description: In previous papers we have proposed an elementary discipline of strong
    functional programming (ESFP), in which all computations terminate. A key feature
    of the discipline is that we introduce a type distinction between data which is
    known to be finite, and codata which is (potentially) infinite. To ensure termination,
    recursion over data must be well-founded, and corecursion (the definition schema
    for codata) must be productive, and both of these restrictions must be enforced
    automatically by the compiler. In our previous work we used abstract interpretation
    to establish the productivity of corecursive definitions in an elementary strong
    functional language. We show here that similar ideas can be applied in the dual
    case to check whether recursive function definitions are strongly normalising.
    We thus exhibit a powerful termination analysis technique which we demonstrate
    can be extended to partial functions.

    consider each of the principles of termination of right as an opportunity to form
    a qualitatively new subject of re-search and development of the local legal system.
    The article analyzes the general grounds for termination of rights and suggests

  description: '<p>In this article, it is pointed out that the requirement for organogenetic
    termination is the new spatial constraint for animal development and heredity,
    based on that: (a) organogenesis manifests limitation in time and possession of
    termination, while infinite cell proliferation known as cancer is lethal; (b)
    the notable indeterminate growth in some fishes and a few outgrowing skin derivatives
    reversely demonstrates that termination is required for organogenesis inside the
    animal. In further, it is supplemented this new spatial constraint to Haeckel
    and von Baer for development and evolution. While not influencing the temporal
    and spatial reorganization of morphogenesis during evolution, it places restrictions
    on alteration of organogenetic mechanisms themselves, as that: (a) addition of
    new induction mechanism or elimination of termination mechanism would usually
    cause endless organogenesis, liable to become lethal; (b) addition of new termination
    mechanism or elimination of induction mechanism in evolution not be affected by
    this spatial constraint. Finally, it is identified this spatial constraint as
    partial convergence and partial difference with Haeckel&rsquo;s recapitulation,

- name: Soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions after perennial legume termination in an alfalfa-wheat
    crop rotation system under Mediterranean conditions
  website: null
  description: 'Agricultural activities are potential sources of greenhouse gas (GHG)
    emissions, and nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the most important non-carbon-dioxide
    GHGs. Perennial legumes such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) have potential roles
    for reduction of soil GHG emissions as part of crop rotation systems. However,
    the implications of perennial legume termination by tillage and subsequent soil
    incorporation of the residues for reduced GHG emissions have been poorly examined
    in Mediterranean environments. With the aim to assess the magnitude of soil N2O
    emissions (important for the definition of mitigation strategies) after perennial
    legume termination in alfalfa-wheat crop rotation systems in a Mediterranean environment,
    we defined the hypothesis that alfalfa termination by tillage with incorporation
    of the crop residues will increase soil N2O emissions during the subsequent wheat
    season. To test this hypothesis, closed static chambers were used in a field–plot
    experiment, using a complete randomised block design with three replicates. Soil
    N2O emissions were monitored across 33 sampling dates from October 2017 to July
    2018, as a comparison between an original 6-year-old alfalfa field (''continuous
    alfalfa'') and alfalfa termination followed by wheat (''alfalfa+ wheat''). The
    soil N2O emission fluxes varied markedly across the treatments and throughout
    the monitoring period (from – 0.02±0.01 to 0.53±0.14 g N-N2O ha–1 h–1, and from
    0.02±0.07 to 0.37±0.11 g N-N2O ha–1 h–1 for continuous alfalfa and alfalfa+wheat,
    respectively), generally following the changes in soil temperature. Several soil
    N2O emission peaks were recorded for both treatments, which mainly coincided with
    rainfall and with increased soil water content. In the 2 months following alfalfa
    termination, alfalfa+wheat showed higher cumulative weekly soil N2O emissions
    compared to continuous alfalfa. Following alfalfa termination for alfalfa+wheat,
    the increased cumulative weekly soil N2O emissions appeared to be due to asynchrony
    between nitrogen (N) released into the soil from mineralisation of the alfalfa
    residues and N uptake by the wheat. Despite these initial high soil N2O emissions
    for alfalfa+wheat, the seasonal cumulative soil N2O emissions were not significantly
    different (0.77±0.09 vs 0.85±0.18 kg N-N2O ha–1 for continuous alfalfa and alfalfa+wheat,
    respectively). These data suggest that legume perennial crop termination in alfalfa–wheat
    rotation systems does not lead to significant loss of N2O from the soil. The alfalfa
    termination by tillage performed in autumn might, on the one hand, have slowed
    the mineralisation process, and might, on the other hand, have synchronised the
    N release by the mineralised crop residues, with the N uptake by the wheat reducing
    the soil N2O emissions.

    Highlights - Soil N2O emissions peak after alfalfa termination and rainfall. -
    Soil N2O emissions increase after spring alfalfa mowing. - Seasonal cumulative
    soil N2O emissions are similar for alfalfa and alfalfa followed by wheat. - Mitigation
    effects of perennial legume on soil N2O emissions are not lost after termination
    by tillage under alfalfa-wheat rotation.'
